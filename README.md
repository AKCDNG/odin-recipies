This is my first TOP project and also my first HTML project. It is a recipe website. 

So far, I have a small understanding of the command line, GIT, Github & now a HTML. 

Still very much in the beginner process, but this is all very excitng. For some reason, it feels like a thrill when pushing to Github, maybe because it feels like the project is becoming official.

Once I have completed this webpage, I would've demonstrated my foundation knowledge in HTML, as well as an understanding of using GIT commands to link this repo to Github.

Even so, enjoy! Wish me luck :D
