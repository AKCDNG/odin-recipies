    Here is one of my all time favourites. You can never go wrong with a 
    fried egg! As long as you don't overcook it.. Then it can taste very
    strange. A great addition to this recipe is avocado, so we'll be including
    it within out recipe.

    Frying an egg isn't too difficult, but you have to make sure you time
    it correctly. Also things like oil spread in the pan can affect the
    egg taste. Choosing different oil or butter can also change the taste
    of the egg. Lets get to it!
