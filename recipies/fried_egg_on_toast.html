    Here is one of my all time favourites. You can never go wrong with a 
    fried egg! As long as you don't overcook it.. Then it can taste very
    strange. A great addition to this recipe is avocado, so we'll be including
    it within out recipe.

<p>
    Frying an egg isn't too difficult, but you have to make sure you time
    it correctly. Also things like oil spread in the pan can affect the
    egg taste. Choosing different oil or butter can also change the taste
    of the egg. Lets get to it!

<h2>ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 Large Eggs</li>
    <li>2 Slices of Bread</li>
    <li>2 Avocado's</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Peel the avocado's and mash them up in a bowl. The texture should
        feel spreadable once they are mashed up.
    </li>

    <li>
        Pop the bread in the toaster. Set the toaster for 3 minutes.
        <strong>Do not start the toaster yet. We are just preparing.</strong>
    </li>

    <li>Pop the frying pan on a low - medium heat. Poor a little olive oil
        around the pan. Do not be afraid to be a little generous with the 
        oil - just so it spreads the pan evenly.
    </li>

    <li>Once the oil has heated up, crack both eggs in the pan. One on
        each side of the pan if possible. Set a timer for 5 minutes.
    </li>

    <li>Once 1 minute has gone by, start the toaster.</li>

    <li>
        3 minutes later, the toaster should pop up and your eggs should be
        nicely cooked. Pop the pan on the lowest heat. Once that is done, spread
        the mashed avocado on the toast evenly.
    </li>

    <li>
        Once the timer finishes, turn the hob off. Place your eggs on top of
        the avocado toast. Season as you wish with salt and pepper.
    </li>
