<p>Scrambled eggs is an all time favourite dish of mine. It is super simple
    and easy to make. It takes less than 5 minutes and only requires very
    few ingredients. It is a great breakfast for yourself, or someone else.

    Today we'll look at how to make the perfect scrambled eggs on toast. 
    I personally have been making this recipe for around 4 years now. There
    are some little tips and tricks to making the perfect scrambed eggs - 
    I shall reveal all soon...
</p>

<p>Scrambled eggs should feel very soft in the mouth. It is also greatly
    complimented with roasted cherry tomatoes and mushrooms. Gordon Ramsey
    has said: "I judge a cook on how good their scrambed eggs are". He is
    absolutely right. This dish is so simple, yet can feel very tough to 
    cook correctly. Lets get started ..

<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
    <li>2 slices Of Brown/White bread</li>
    <li>Butter</li>
    <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    <li><strong>Optional: </strong>Cherry Tomatoes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Crack all 3 eggs into a bowl. Whisk with a fork firmly until the 
        yolks have broken in & the eggs look 'yellow-y'.
    </li>

    <li>Once whisked, prepare your toaster by putting 2 slices of bread 
        in the toaster. <strong>Make sure the toaster is set for 3 minutes.</strong>
    </li>

    <li>Grab a wooden spatula. This is what you'll be using to move the eggs around in the pan
    </li>

    <li>Set the frying pan to a low - medium heat. Place a knob of butter 
        in there. Allow it to melt, but be sure to make sure it melts 
        evenly around the pan.
    </li>

    <li>Start toasting your bread. At this point, the butter should start to 
        pop. Pour your whisked eggs into the frying pan.
    </li>

    <li>Grab your wooden spatula, start to turn the eggs onto each other in
        a circular motion. After 5 seconds on the hob, place the pan
        on your kitchen surface & stir consistently with your spatula.
    </li>

    <li>After it has been off the hob for a few seconds, put it back on. Stir 
        on the hob for 10 seconds, then off for 5 seconds. Repeat.
    </li>

    <li>Your arms will hurt, but you must not stop stiring the eggs on itself.
        After a couple of minutes you'll start to see the eggs almost solidifying.
        That is a good sign.
    </li>

    <li>After 3 minutes, your eggs will be done and your toast will be ready.
        Once you feel the eggs are scrambled, add a small knob of butter on
        top and mix it in. This will give the scrambled eggs a lovely smooth texture.
    </li>

        <li>Place the eggs on the toast. <strong>Do not butter the toast.
        the butter from the eggs will do that for you. 
    </strong>Season with salt & pepper
        </li>
</ol>
